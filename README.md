# Mail Preflight [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kkonstantin42/mail-preflight.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kkonstantin42/mail-preflight)

Mail Preflight is a tool for preprocessing email HTML.
Currently that includes:
* Inlining css
* Removing html comments
* Applying augmented css (a silly name that means setting html attributes using special css properties)


## State of the project
Project is currently in a process of being open sourced. It started as a css inliner tool in a different closed source project. Main functionality is tested but there is no documentation, no proper tests and it's not published to maven central yet. Api might also change in the near future.


## Contributions
Contributions are currently not accepted (or rather not expected) but that will change soon.
